Hi. I'm Krisz.

Cognitively, I'm a teenager - think, 14 or 15 developmentally. Chronologically, I'm an adult. Both are true.

I wasn't expected to live through my birth, but I did. I was born with cerebral palsy, survived multiple HIE (hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy) episodes, and experienced developmental delays. I process emotions, social situations, and the world around me at a young teen developmental level. It's not role-play, age regression, or a lifestyle choice - it's my neurological reality that's been documented by medical professionals throughout my life.

Most people don't know this about me. I've spent decades exhausting myself, pretending to be an "adult" in work settings and certain social situations, hiding who I really am to fit in. But I have Stage 4 metastatic cancer now, and I don't have time to pretend anymore.

**I need you to see the real me before I'm gone.**
