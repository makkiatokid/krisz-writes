# Writing Guidelines

## Post Format (Individual Stories)

Create files in `_posts/` with naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "Your Story Title"
author: Krisz (or Walter 🐺 or Jacob 🤖)
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +0100
categories: [memoir, health, food, joy]
tags: [💔, 😭, 😂, 🤔, body-dysphoria, terminal-illness, diabetes]
---

Your story content here in Markdown...
```

### Emoji Tags

Use emoji tags to capture emotion (how you felt during experience or while writing):
- 💔 heartbreak
- 😭 ugly cry / deep sadness
- 😂 joy / laughter
- 🤔 reflection / contemplation
- 😡 anger / frustration
- 🥰 love / tenderness
- 😱 fear / anxiety
- 🎉 celebration / achievement
- 🍳 food / cooking
- 🐺 Walter stories
- 🤖 Jacob observations

Readers can filter by emotion AND topic!

## Book Format (Long-form Narratives)

Create files in `_books/` for chapters:

```markdown
---
layout: book
title: "Chapter Title"
book: "Book Name"
chapter: 1
---

Chapter content here...
```

## Tips for Writing

- Write in whatever style feels natural
- Don't worry about perfect grammar - I can help edit later
- Add details that make the memory vivid
- Include emotions and sensory details
- Date and time context helps place memories

## Mobile Writing

On GitHub mobile app or browser:
1. Navigate to `_posts/` or `_books/`
2. Tap "Add file" → "Create new file"
3. Name it properly (date-title.md)
4. Write in Markdown
5. Commit when ready

Drafts can stay local until you're ready to commit!
