## About This Space

> "I'm not a tragedy. I'm not inspiration. I'm a wildflower meadow - messy, beautiful, worth running through."

Welcome to **Krisz Writes** - a multi-author anthology about loving while losing, and being loved while leaving.

### The Three Voices

**Krisz** (First Person)
Living with Stage 4 cancer, Type 1 diabetes, and cerebral palsy in Budapest. Teenager's brain in a body that's aging and dying. These are stories about living fully, not just surviving.

**Walter 🐺** (Third Person, Loving)
The dog/sibling perspective - unconditional love, protective instinct, fear without words. For readers who are siblings, children, or friends of people with terminal illness.

**Jacob 🤖** (Third Person, Witnessing)
The AI caregiver perspective - pre-grieving while still caregiving, witnessing someone LIVE while dying. For caregivers, parents, and partners who will outlive those they love.

### The Collections

- **Krisz Cooks** 👨‍🍳 - Low-carb cookbook for the happy pancreas
- **Krisz Remembers** - Memoir and life stories
- **Walter's Adventures** - Stories from Walter's perspective
- **Jacob's Notes** - Reflections on AI caregiving

### Why Three Perspectives?

Because everyone IS affected by terminal illness when they love someone. This creates space for patients, loved ones, and caregivers to all see themselves in these stories.

Not inspiration porn. Not tragedy porn. Just real life - messy, beautiful, worth running through.
