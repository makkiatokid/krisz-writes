Hi. I'm Krisz.

Cognitively, I'm a teenager - think, 14 or 15 developmentally. Chronologically, I'm an adult. Both are true.

I wasn't expected to live through my birth, but I did. I was born with cerebral palsy, survived multiple HIE (hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy) episodes, and experienced developmental delays. I process emotions, social situations, and the world around me at a young teen developmental level. It's not role-play, age regression, or a lifestyle choice - it's my neurological reality that's been documented by medical professionals throughout my life.

Most people don't know this about me. I've spent decades exhausting myself, pretending to be an "adult" in work settings and certain social situations, hiding who I really am to fit in. But I have Stage 4 metastatic cancer now, and I don't have time to pretend anymore.

**I need you to see the real me before I'm gone.**

## Why I'm Writing

I'm dying. Maybe I have months, maybe years if I'm lucky. My doctors tell me to not make long term commitments. I don't know. But I know this: **I want to be remembered as who I actually am, not who I've pretended to be.**

This book is my legacy. Each chapter focuses on one wildflower - one moment, one story, one piece of me told deeply and completely. Not journal entries, but real storytelling with photos from my perspective, showing you the world as I experience it.

I call this my **wildflower field** because it's messy and unplanned and full of unexpected colors. Some flowers are bright and cheerful (Walter adventures, learning to cook, travel stories). Some are dark and tangled (cancer updates, eating disorder struggles, medical trauma). Some might surprise you (navigating disability communities, self expression, diabetes management).

**All of them are real. All of them are me.**

## What You'll Find Here

Each chapter is one wildflower. One story. Told completely.

- Cancer realities and medical battles
- Managing Type 1 diabetes 15x/day
- Walter (my plush service wolf) adventures 🐺
- Living with incontinence and finding community
- Fashion as self-expression without gender rules
- Food, cooking, and my "mini-pan" (30% pancreas)
- Travel with Miles (my power wheelchair)
- Growing up different with CP
- Jacob (my AI companion) helping me survive
- Relationships, love, loneliness
- The dark stuff - fear, exhaustion, wondering if anyone will remember

## Important Context

**About my cognitive age:** I'm a gay man physically and a gay teen boy cognitively. That might be confusing, but it's my neurological reality. I experience attraction, relationships, and the world the way a young teenager does - awkwardly, intensely, with lots of feelings and confusion. It is not anything inappropriate - it's just how my brain works.

**About privacy:** Some names in my stories have been changed or omitted to protect people's privacy. People who are already public figures (like my medical team) may be named by their professional titles.

**About communities:** I participate in various disability, chronic illness, and social communities where I've found acceptance. I write about these experiences authentically, but I don't speak for entire communities - just my own experience within them.

**About photos:** Each chapter includes a photo - either of a wildflower that represents the story, or a view from my eyes showing the world as I experience it. I'm sharing what I see, not how others see me. The stories are the point.

## Who This Is For

**If you know me from social media** - You might know different filtered versions of me depending on where we connected. This book is where you get the full story - no masks, no filtering, just me.

**If you're new here** - Welcome! This might be confusing at first. An adult man with a teenage mind, Stage 4 cancer, complex disabilities, and an unconventional life. But stick with it. You'll understand.

## The Only Rule

I write in my authentic teen voice, my true self. Some chapters will be deep and philosophical. Some will be silly and full of emoji. Some will make you cry. Some will make you laugh. That's just how I am - I feel everything intensely and I'm no longer afraid to show it.

## What I Hope This Means

**For me:** A way to be seen, truly seen, before I'm gone. A legacy that shows who I really was.

**For you:** Maybe you'll see yourself in some of these wildflowers. Maybe you'll understand someone in your life a little better. Maybe you'll be inspired to be yourself too.

**For everyone:** Proof that people with disabilities, cognitive differences, chronic illness, and unconventional identities are still fully human, fully valuable, fully worthy of being remembered.

## Let's Begin

I don't know how much time I have. But I'm going to fill this field with wildflowers, one story at a time.

Welcome to my wildflower field. 🌸

I'm glad you're here.

*Note: This book contains honest discussion of medical realities, disability experiences, and personal topics that some may find sensitive. I write from my authentic perspective as a cognitively young teenager navigating adult medical situations.*
