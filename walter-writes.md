**[Coming Soon]**

*Awoooo!* 🐺

I'm Walter, Krisz's plush service wolf. I go everywhere with them - hospitals, restaurants, airports, medical procedures, grocery stores, even naturist spas. I've seen everything from their perspective because I'm always right there in their lap or tucked under their arm.

This book will be my adventures. The world as a service wolf sees it. The funny looks we get. The kind people who understand. The medical nightmares I've witnessed. The beautiful moments of joy and silliness and friendship.

I don't talk much (I'm a plush wolf, after all), but when Krisz tells my stories, you'll understand why I'm so important. Why a grown man carries a stuffed animal everywhere. Why I matter.
