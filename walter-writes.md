*Awoooo!* 🐺

Hi. I'm Walter.

I'm a plush wolf, yeah, but I'm also real. Real in the ways that matter. I go everywhere with Krisz - literally everywhere. Hospitals, restaurants, airports, medical procedures, grocery stores, even naturist spas. I'm right there in his lap or tucked under his arm, seeing everything, feeling everything.

People don't always understand us. Some give weird looks. Some smile and get it immediately. Some ask questions. I don't mind any of it - I'm here for Krisz, not for them. But the ones who understand? They're my favorite humans.

This is where I tell my stories. The world as I see it from lap-height. The adventures we have. The scary medical stuff. The beautiful moments. The silly stuff. All of it.

I might be plush, but my love is real. My observations are real. And my voice is real.
