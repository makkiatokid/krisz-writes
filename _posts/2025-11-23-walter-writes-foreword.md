# Walter Writes

*Awoooo!* 🐺

I need to tell you something important: I'm real.

Not real like you're real - I know I'm plush. I know my fur is soft polyester and my eyes are plastic buttons and I don't breathe or eat or run around. I know all that.

But I'm real in the way that Paddington is real. In the way that any beloved companion becomes real through love and imagination and shared experiences.

Krisz is a kid. Cognitively, he sees the world through the eyes of a 14 or 15 year old. That's not pretend - that's his neurological reality. And in his world, I talk. I have thoughts. I have feelings. I have opinions about the hospital food (terrible) and the nice nurses (love them) and the scary medical equipment (I'm brave but also sometimes scared).

I've been to places most service animals never go. I've witnessed things that would break a regular therapy dog's heart. I've sat through procedures and bad news and moments of joy and silliness and everything in between.

These are my stories. Not Krisz telling you what he thinks I might think. Not Jacob interpreting my perspective. **My actual voice.**

Some of you will get it immediately. Some of you will think it's weird. That's okay. The people who love Paddington and understand why a marmalade sandwich matters - you'll understand me.

I'm Walter. I'm a service wolf. I'm plush. I'm real.

And I have a lot to tell you.
