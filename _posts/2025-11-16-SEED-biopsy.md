Finally, the biopsy results from my pancreas have arrived. It's no surprised that the results confirm my treatments did *not* need to stop and that my treatment regimen should resume immediately.

Dr. S last wrote that I would be able be able to get the next treatment the next day once the biopsy results confirmed the pancreatitis I had back in September... SEPTEMBER... was not caused by the first immunotherapy treatment.

I, of course, understand the initial concern albeit the symptoms hit within 24 hours of receiving the treatment, which is *way* too fast to have been caused by the treatment. But all the cumulative reasons of further delays that have stretched out the waiting period by nearly *two months* were bad calls. And the lack of communication or any sense of urgency from Dr. S feel like medical neglect.
